Migrated this back from [inu.io](https://www.inu.io) to [hallajs.net](https://www.hallajs.net) for now and keeping it hosted under [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I suppose I'm trying to split the functionalities of both environments again, oh well.

At least had the chance to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy this static page with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), so that's that.
