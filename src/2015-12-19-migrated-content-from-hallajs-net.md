I have "again" allowed my hallajs.net domain to expire and I'll only be maintaining [inu.io](http://inu.io "inu.io") as of now.

I've also migrated the content of hallajs.net here (although, I have to admit, it took a very long time).

This site is now running on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com "Middleman") instead of [Ghost](http://ghost.io "Ghost") :)
