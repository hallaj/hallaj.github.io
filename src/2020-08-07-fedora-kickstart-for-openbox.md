For a while now, I've been installing [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) either through the netinstall method, or using the server's ISO to install just the base OS before setting up [Openbox](http://openbox.org) during the first boot.

However, after the recent OS reinstallation that I had, I wondered if it's actually possible to have an ISO ready for me, with just the change I need and after reading around, I found [Kickstart](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/install-guide/advanced/Kickstart_Installations/) and that's helped me to archieve this goal.

So, if anyone's ever interested in trying out a custom Spin of [Fedora](https://getfedora.org) with [Openbox](http://openbox.org) (of course with my tweaks and dotfiles), feel free to build it yourself and have a go at it.

You could find the project on my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) page under [Fedora Openbox Kickstart](https://gitlab.com/muhammadhallaj/fedora-openbox-kickstart).
